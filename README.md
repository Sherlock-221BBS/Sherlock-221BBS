- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Taki Hasan, I am currently a sophomore at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College
- ðŸ‘€ let's be clear on something - when something a machine can do, why should we bother? Therefore instead of creating the rules of a complex program, I prefer machines to find out those complex rules. And you know it,  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are the way to do it. That's why I am just in love with Machine Learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Natural Language Processing, Image Classification.
- ðŸ“« Do you have something to say about whether Robots will become sentient or not or do have some cool project idea in your head? You can reach me by emailing me at taki1656hasan@gmail.com
